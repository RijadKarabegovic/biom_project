# React App - Readme

This repository contains a React app that is deployed on Netlify with continuous deployment enabled through webhooks on pushes/merges to the master branch.

## Getting Started

To run the React app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone <repository_url>`

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   `cd <project_directory>`

3. Install the dependencies:
   `npm install`

4. Start the development server:
   `npm start`

   This will launch the app in your default browser. Any changes you make to the source code will automatically refresh the page.

## Deployment

The app is deployed on Netlify, and the deployment process is triggered automatically on pushes or merges to the master branch. This is achieved through the use of webhooks.

## Continuous Deployment

Continuous deployment is set up to ensure that the latest version of the app is always deployed whenever changes are made to the master branch. When a push or merge occurs, the webhooks notify Netlify to initiate the build and deployment process.
